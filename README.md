# Customer Counter

This app allows users to count the amount of customers that enter within your store. Each time you click the customer button the customer count is increased by 1, and
each time you click the save button it resets your customer count to 0 while saving the previous amount of customers that entered your store. This helps to keep track
and log as many customers as you like for the day!
